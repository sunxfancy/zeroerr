Contributing
===========
We encourage developers to contribute to this project, but please follow the rules below:
1. Please ask in the issue before planning to modify whether it is feasible and can be merged into the main branch
2. Please make sure that all unit tests are passed before fixing bugs, and add the unit tests of bugs to the test directory
3. All PRs should be sent to the dev branch, and the master branch will never directly accept PRs
4. Please be sure to keep the Chinese and English versions consistent when modifying all documents and tutorials
5. Please make sure to use English for comments in the code to avoid compiler encoding problems
6. Make sure that the modified project has been completely built once, so that the merged version `zeroerr.hpp` file in the root directory is consistent with the source code
7. We welcome the extension of special environment use and the integration of third-party libraries. Please put these extensions in the extension directory
