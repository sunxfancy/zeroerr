Assertion
===========
[TOC]


Assertion library provided a list of marcos and functions for you to check condition in both your source code and unit testing code.

### Basic Usage

A basic assertion marco is in one the following format:

CHECK(<expr> [, <message>, <args>...])

or

CHECK(<expr> OP <expr> [, <message>, <args>...])
which OP could be one of the `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`

or 

CHECK(<cond> OP <cond> [, <message>, <args>...])
which OP could be `AND`/`OR`, <cond> could be an `<expr>` or `<expr> OP <expr>`


To reduce the complexity of parsing the expression and improve performance, we also provided a list of old style marcos:

- CHECK_EQ(a, b) Check if equal  `==`
- CHECK_NE(a, b) Check if not equal   `!=`
- CHECK_LT(a, b) Check less than   `<`
- CHECK_GT(a, b) Check greater than   `>`
- CHECK_LE(a, b) Check less than and equal  `<=`
- CHECK_GE(a, b) Check greater than and equal `>=`

### Assertion Level

There are 3 levels of assertion marcos, you can replace CHECK to REQUIRE or ASSERT:

* CHECK    - There is something wrong happened but we still be able to continue run and get the result.
* REQUIRE  - The current function don't allow continue work and will throw and error.
* ASSERT   - The current program don't allow this happened and we must exit, there is no way to continue.


### Variant

CHECK_NOT, REQUIRE_NOT, and ASSERT_NOT  will check the condition which is expected not true.

CHECK_THROWS, REQUIRE_THROWS, and ASSERT_THROWS will expect the expression will throw an exception.
