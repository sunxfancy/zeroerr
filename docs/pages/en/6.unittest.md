Unit Testing
===============
[TOC]

### Basic Usage
To perform unit testing, you typically write test cases for the functionality you're testing. These test cases are small code snippets that call the function or method with certain inputs and then check to see if the output is what you expect.

### Fuzzing Test Cases
Fuzzing is an advanced testing technique that involves automatically generating random data as inputs to a software program. The goal is to find cases where the program fails or behaves unexpectedly. This can be particularly useful for discovering security vulnerabilities or crashes.

### Benchmarks
Benchmark tests are designed to measure the performance of a unit of software under a particular workload. They are useful for identifying performance regressions and verifying that performance optimizations have the intended effect.
